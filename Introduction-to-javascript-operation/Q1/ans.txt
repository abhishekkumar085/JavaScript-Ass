Operators are the fundamental building blocks of programming languages like JavaScript. They play a crucial role in performing operations on data and manipulating the flow of program execution. Without operators, programming would be limited to simply storing and retrieving data, lacking the ability to transform, compare, or control program behavior.

Role of Operators in JavaScript

Operators in JavaScript serve various purposes, including:

Arithmetic Operations: Perform mathematical calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Comparison Operations: Evaluate relationships between values, such as equality, inequality, greater than, less than, and so on.

Logical Operations: Combine boolean values to form conditions and control program execution based on logical expressions.

Assignment Operations: Assign values to variables, modifying data storage and program state.

Bitwise Operations: Manipulate binary representations of values, often used for low-level programming tasks.

Increment/Decrement Operations: Modify variable values by adding or subtracting one, commonly used for looping and counting.

Conditional Operations: Evaluate expressions and select specific code paths based on conditions, allowing for conditional execution.
