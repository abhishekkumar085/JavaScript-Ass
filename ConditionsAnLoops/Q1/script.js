// Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. These statements enable your program to make decisions and respond dynamically to different situations.

// there are two types of conditional statement-
// 1.if
// 2.else

// syntax----

// if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
// } else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
// }


// Example

const age=17;
if(age>=18){
    console.log("You can vote..")
}else{
    console.log("You cannot vote")
}
