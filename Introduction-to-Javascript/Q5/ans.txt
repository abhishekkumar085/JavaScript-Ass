Importance of Comments

1.Code Readability: Comments enhance the readability of code by providing explanations and context, making it easier for other developers to understand the intent of the code.

2.Code Maintainability: As code evolves and undergoes modifications, comments provide valuable insights into the original structure and intent, facilitating future maintenance and updates.

3.Self-Documentation: Comments act as self-documentation, reducing the need for external documentation and providing a reference point for developers revisiting the code.

Types of Comments

Single-Line Comments: These comments are used for brief explanations or annotations. They start with two forward slashes (//) and end at the end of the line.
Example:

// This variable stores the user's age
let age = 30;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Multi-Line Comments: These comments are used for more extensive explanations or documentation. They start with /* and end with */.
Example:


/*
   This function calculates the sum of two numbers
   @param num1: The first number
   @param num2: The second number
   @return: The sum of num1 and num2
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
