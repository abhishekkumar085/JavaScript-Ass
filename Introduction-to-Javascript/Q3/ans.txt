JavaScript has five primitive data types:

1.Number: Represents numeric values, including integers (whole numbers) and decimals (numbers with fractional parts).

example:-
let age = 25;
let temperature = 32.5;

2.String: Represents sequences of characters, typically used for text or any sequence of symbols.

example:-
let name = "John Doe";
let message = "Hello, World!";

3.Boolean: Represents true or false values, often used for logical conditions or flags.

example:-
let isStudent = true;
let isActive = false;

4.Undefined: Represents an uninitialized or unassigned value.

example:-

let variable1;
let variable2 = undefined;

5.Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.

example:-

let emptyValue = null;
